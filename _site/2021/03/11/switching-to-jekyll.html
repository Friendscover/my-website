<p>You know I’m one of that kind of people who grew up with really slow internet (and still uses slow internet today). Especially nowaday sites are often full of assets that take way to long to load (atleast for me, the web should be fast!). I know, I know that’s an really subjectiv case and I know it does not apply to you.</p>
