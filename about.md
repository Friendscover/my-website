## About me

Hi, my name is Tobias Klöpper and I am currently working as a Projectmanager at [Agriportance](https://agriportance.com/). 
Previously I studied Agriculture in Germany and finished my Bachelors Degree in the summer of 2021! During my free time I spend some time learning Ruby on Rails with the help of TheOdinProject. You can follow my progress at [Github](https://github.com/Friendscover).

When I am not studying, I'm helping on my parents' farm, try to improve my bouldering skills and play some games with friends.
