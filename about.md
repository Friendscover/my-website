Hi, my name is Tobias Klöpper and I am currently working as a Projectmanager at [agriportance](https://agriportance.com/). At agriportance I am responsible for consulting customers during and after the sustainability certification process in the ISSC and REDcert system. 

Previously I studied agriculture in Germany and finished my Bachelors Degree in the summer of 2021! During my free time I am learning Ruby on Rails with the help of TheOdinProject. You can follow my progress at [Github](https://github.com/Friendscover).

But not all of my free time is used to code. I am also engaged in indoor rock climbing and sometimes my friends and I play some games together.

Currently I am checking out Mastodon. If you are using it yourself, feel free to follow me/reach out.

Feel free to contact me regarding biogas or biomethane projects.

## What am I currently working on?

- Building a watering tracker for my plants at home
- Improving my homeserver setup
