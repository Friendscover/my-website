Hello there 👋, thanks for checking out my small blog. My name is Tobias Klöpper and I am currently working at **eco-gruppe**.

Previously I studied agriculture in Germany and finished my studies in the summer of 2021! During my free time I am learning Ruby on Rails with the help of ThedinProject. You can follow my progress at [Github](https://github.com/Friendscover).

But not all of my free time is used to code. I am also engaged in indoor rock climbing and sometimes my friends and I play some games together.
