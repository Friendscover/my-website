## About me

<img src="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/37114020?s=460&u=4d138f07b6d7214db31244226181ba42bc2388e7&v=4" alt="Tobias Klöppers Foto">

Hi, my name is Tobias Klöpper and I am currently studying Agriculture in Germany. During my free time I spend some time learning Ruby on Rails with the help of TheOdinProject. You can follow my progress at [Github](https://github.com/Friendscover).

When I am not studying, I help on my parents' farm, try to improve my bouldering skills and play some games with friends.

## Stuff I am looking into

- No-Till Planting/Planting Green
- Animal Husbandry/Nutrition (Chickens)  

## Additions to this site

- More blog posts
- Maybe there will be room for a feeding calculator 
- ~~a blog about agriculture and tech~~
