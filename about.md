Hi, my name is Tobias Klöpper and I am currently working as a Projectmanager at [agriportance](https://agriportance.com/). 
Previously I studied agriculture in Germany and finished my Bachelors Degree in the summer of 2021! During my free time I am learning Ruby on Rails with the help of TheOdinProject. You can follow my progress at [Github](https://github.com/Friendscover).

But not all of my free time is used to code. I am also engaged in indoor rock climbing and sometimes my friends and I play some games together.
